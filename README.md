# 📘 Python Learning Journey – 9 Days Progress

Day 2: Conditional Statements
This folder contains 5 Python programs demonstrating different ways to use conditional logic.

# 📘 Python Learning Journey – 9 Days Progress

This repository documents my 9-day Python learning journey, with a special focus on `if-else` conditional statements. The purpose of this README is to summarize what I studied, practiced, and understood during this period.



## 🎯 What I Studied

### 1️⃣ Basics of `if` Statement

* Learned how to use `if` to make decisions in Python
* Understood indentation and syntax rules
* Practiced simple conditions (true / false)

Example concepts:

 Checking whether a number is greater or less than another number
 Comparing values using `>` `<` and `==`

---

 2️⃣ `if-else` Conditions

* Learned how `if-else` works when a condition is true or false
* Practiced decision-making programs

Programs practiced:

* Checking whether a character is an alphabet, number, or special character.
* Checking whether a character is uppercase or lowercase
* Checking whether a character is a vowel or consonant

- Uppercase or lowercase checker
- Digit or special character checker

---

 6️⃣ Password Validation (Mini Task)

* Applied multiple conditions together
* Learned how to loop through characters

Conditions checked:

* Minimum length
* At least one digit
* At least one uppercase letter

---
 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

* Decision making using conditions
* Writing clean and readable logic
* Combining multiple conditions
* Understanding program flow
* Basic input validation

---

## 🚀 Skills Gained

* Strong understanding of `if-else` logic
* Improved problem-solving ability
* Confidence in writing exam-oriented Python programs
